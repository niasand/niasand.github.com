Hello darkness my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted
In my brain still remains
Within the sound of silence

In restless dreams I walked along
Narrow streets of cobble stone
Beneath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of a neon light
That split the light
And touched the sound of silence

And in the naked light I saw
Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
People writing songs that voices never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence

"Fool" said I,"You do not know
Silence like a cancer grows
Hear my words that I might teach you
Take my arms that I might reach you"
But my words like silent raindrops fell
And echoed in the walls of silence

And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made
And the sign flashed out its warning
In the words that it was forming
And the signs said "The words of the prophets
are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls"
Whispering in the sounds of silence


这是电影《毕业生》里面的一首歌，似乎也多少代表了我现在的心境，平平淡淡的，又稍带一些惶恐与不安，

但仍旧是那么的舒坦的在过日子，刚听完汇编老师的扯淡，没有心情再去上毛泽东思想了，

最近看到了许多不和谐的声音，愈发觉得毛泽东思想这样的课懒得去上了。

我不知道现在该说些什么了，朋友的渐行渐远，但是我希望见面还能聊上几句，还是和以前那么一样的开心，

为什么都有了伴侣后都淡漠了？为什么怕打搅而不联络了？为什么都在害怕着若即若离离带来的尴尬了？

为什么都沉默寡言了？这些问题其实我们都知道答案，只是却也不能说！人生也不是如此么？

我们都知道成功该如何去做，有很多事我们都知道该如何做？可真的我们去按照我们的真实意愿去做了吗？

没有。我也寡言了，我也渐渐的消失在这片曾经的乐土了。那时候玩QQ多么的开心，

两个人在网吧，面对面的用它聊天，现在呢？呵呵……
