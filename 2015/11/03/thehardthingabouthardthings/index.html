    <p>花了两个星期的时间，读完了这本《The hard thing about the hard thing》，感触颇深，创业不易，生活更加不易，每个成功者的背后，即使是乔布斯，都是有着说不清的辛酸与痛苦。Life is struggle, learn  to embrace.</p>
<p>1.Turn your shit in (P4)</p>
<p>2.Leader ship is the ability to get someone to follow you even if only out of curiosity.(P5)</p>
<p>3.In particularly dire circumstances when the “faces” seemed to dictate a certain outcome, I learned to look for alternative narratives and explanations coming from radically different perspectives to inform my outlook. The simple existence of an alternate, plausible scenario is often all that’s needed to keep hope alive among a worried workforce(P5)</p>
<p>4.I felt like I had unlimited bandwidth and could do everything in life that I wanted to do simultaneously.(P8)</p>
<p>5.It was the first time that I forced myself to look at the world through priorities that were not purely my own.(P8)</p>
<p>6.Most business relationships either become too tense to tolerate or not tense enough to be productive after a while. Either people challenge each other to the point where they don’t like each other or they become complacent about each other’s feedback and no longer benefit from the relationship.(P14)</p>
<p>7.You need two kinds of friends in your life. The first kind is one you can call when something good happens, and you need someone who will be excited for you. Not a fake excitement veiling envy, but a real excitement. The second kind of friend is somebody you can call when things go horribly wrong —- when your life is on the line and you only have one phone call. (P22)</p>
<p>8.Rememeber,Ben,things are always darkest before they go completely black.(P28)</p>
<p>9.These were exceptional times, but resetting guidance on  you very first earnings call was still a very bad thing to do.(P29)</p>
<p>10.I asked him to draw the EDS organizational chart one more time to see if we could find someone influential at EDS whom we hadn’t yet approached.(P35)</p>
<p>11.If we hadn’t treated the people who were leaving fairly, the people who stayed would never have trusted me again. Only a CEO who had been through some awful, horrible, devastating circumstances would know to give that advice at that time.(P37)</p>
<p>12.An early lesson I learned in my career was that whenever a large organization attempts to do anything, it always comes down to single person who can delay the entire project.(P43)</p>
<p>13.We were fighting for our lives, but he was about to lose his.(P47)</p>
<p>14.Ordinarily in a staff meeting,  you spend lots of time reviewing, evaluating, and improving all of the things that you do: build products, sell productions, support customers, hire employees, and the like. Sometimes, however, the things you’re not doing are the things you should actually be focused on.(P51)</p>
<p>15.Early in my career as an engineer, I’d learned that all decisions were objective until the line of code was written. After that, all decisions were emotional.(P51)</p>
<p>16.How could I have done that? I was sick. I couldn’t sleep, I had cold sweats, I threw up, and I cried. And then I realized that it was the smartest thing that I’d ever done in my career. We built something from nothing, saw it go back to nothing again, and then rebuilt it into a $1.65 billion franchise.(P55)</p>
<p>17.Startup CEOS should not play the odds. When you are building a company, you must believe there is an answer and you cannot pay attention to you odds of finding it. You just have to find it. It matters not whether you chances are nine in ten or one in a thousand; your task is the same.(P59)</p>
<p>18.I follow the first principle of the Bushido — the way of the warrior: keep death in mind at all times.(P59)</p>
<p>19.Every great entrepreneur from Steve Jobs to Mark Zuckerberg went through the Struggle and struggle the did, so you are not alone. But that does not mean that  you will make it. You may not make it. That s why it is the Struggle.(P62)</p>
<p>20.You are laying people of because the company failed to hit its plan.(P70)</p>
<p>21.The message is for about how you treat their colleagues.(P71)</p>
<p>22.Ironcally, the key to an emotional discussion is to take the emotion out of it.(P82)</p>
<p>23.Both leading indicators may have been wrong, or both may have been right, but our hypothetical CEO – like almost every other CEO– only took action on the positive indicator and only looked for alternative explanations on the negative leading indicator.(P87)</p>
<p>24.There is no silver bullet that’s going to fix that. No, we are going to have to use a lot of leading bullets.(P88)</p>
<p>25.If our company isn’t good enough to win, then we need to exist at all?(P90)</p>
<p>26.And they right not to care. A great reason for failing won’t preserve one dollar for your investors, won’t save one employee’s job, or get you one dollar for your investors, won’t save one employee’s job, or get you one new customer. It especially won’t make you feel one bit better when you shut down your company and declare bankruptcy. All the metal energy you use to elaborate your misery would be far better used trying to find the one seemingly impossible way out of your current mess. Spend zero time on what you could have done, and devote all of your time on what you might do. Because in the end, nobody cares; just run your company.(P92)</p>
<p>27.He explained further that even with all those things, a successful sales leader still must inspire courage in the team.</p>
<p>28.The world looks one way in peacetime but very different when you must fight for your life every day. In times of peace, one has time to care about things like appropriateness, long-term cultural consequences, and people’s feelings. In time of war, killing the enemy and getting the troops safely home is all that counts.(P97)</p>
<p>29.If he didn’t have the things wrong with him that you enumerated, he wouldn’t be willing to join a company that just trade at thirty-five cents per share; he’d be CEO of IBM.(P98)</p>
<p>30.”Taking care of people” is the most difficult of the three by far and if you don’t do it, the other two won’t matter.</p>
<p>31.With that mind. The best way to deal with these situation is openly and transparently.(P117)</p>
<p>32.In my case, I did not cripple to the team, but I screwed up my priorities. The right thing to do would have been to make the hard decision up front, about what was more important, maximizing each quarter or increasing predictability.(P132)</p>
<p>33.As a result, many young companies overemphasize retention metrics and do not spend enough time going deep enough on the actual user experience.(P132)</p>
<p>34.The white box goes beyond the numbers. It penalizes managers who sacrifice the future for the short term and rewards those who invest in the future even if that investment cannot be easily measured.(P133)</p>
<p>35.Sometimes an organization doesn’t need a solution; it just need clarity. … At least as far as I knew. Bottom line, the results of the policy were good: a comfortable work environment, low attrition, and no complaining. Sometimes the right policy is the one that the CEO can follow.(P145)</p>
<p>36.As defined by Andy Grove, the right kind of ambition is ambition for the company’s success with the executive’s own success only coming as a by-product of the company’s victory.(P150)</p>
<p>37.Once you decide, you should immediately execute the reorg: Don’t leave time for leaks and lobbying.(P151)</p>
<p>38.The Law of Crappy People states: For any title level in a large organization, the talent on that level will eventually coverage to the crappiest person with title.(P161)</p>
<p>39.Why would a smart person to destroy the company that he works for? She is disempowered? She is fundamentally? She is immature and naive?(P166)</p>
<p>40.If one of your big dogs destroys communication on your staff, you need to send here to the pond.(P168)</p>
<p>41.When the head of sales gets promoted from within, she almost always fails. Asking yourself, “Do I vale internal or external knowledge more for this position?” will help you determine whether to go for experience or youth.(P172)</p>
<p>42.It is true that some of  those cultures will have properties  that are superior to your own. But this is your company, your culture, and your way of doing business. Do not be intimidated by experience on this issue; stick to your guns and stick to your culture.(P173)</p>
<p>43.It is not nearly enough that someone on your staff can do the job better than you can, because  you are incompetent at the job—that’s why you hired them in the first place.</p>
<p>44.Focus on where you are going rather than on what you hope to avoid.(P207)</p>
<p>45.People who watch you judge  you on what you do, not how you feel.(P209)</p>
<p>46.In my experience as CEO, I found that the most important decisions tested my courage far more than my intelligence.(P209)</p>
<p>47.How can she kill the product when she is not even sure if she is making the right decision and everyone is against her? If she’s wrong, she will have been wrong in the face of advice from her top advisers. If she is right, will anybody even know?(P211)</p>
<p>48.I never once felt brave. In fact, I often felt sacred to death. I never lost those feelings, but after much practice I learned to ignore them. That learning process might also be called the courage development process.(P212)</p>
<p>49.When Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the company was weeks away from bankruptcy – a classic wartime scenario. He needed everyone to move with precision and follow his exact plan; there was no room for individual creativity outside the core mission. In dark contrast, as Google achieved dominance in the search market, Google’s management fostered peacetime innovation by enabling and even requiring every employee to spend 20 percent of their time on their own new projects.(P226)</p>
<p>50.The more I thought about my future, the more I thought about my past.(P265)</p>
<p>51.Life is struggle. Embrace your weirdness,  your background, your instinct. If the keys are not in there, they do not exist.(P275)</p>
